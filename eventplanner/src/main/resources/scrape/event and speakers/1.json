[{"event":{"title":"Towards a Canadian Energy and Environment Strategy","url":"","description":"The energy sector has always been subject to degrees of uncertainty, but the current position of Canada\u0027s energy sector is as volatile as it has been in years, even decades. It is becoming increasingly difficult for Canada to move major energy projects forward and to help Canada shift to a cleaner energy future. Given the important role energy plays directly and indirectly in Canada\u0027s economy, as well as the impact that it has on the environment and society as a whole, Canada needs a responsible, well-informed dialogue on the range of issues flowing from the energy sector. The Conference Board of Canada believes that a holistic approach, involving multiple stakeholders across the full spectrum of the energy industry, can advance a Canadian energy and environment strategy. It is for this reason that we are holding this important event which we hope will serve as a platform to launch a new initiative in this area: The Centre on Energy, Environment and Economy to help move a strategy forward in earnest. Given the important role energy plays directly and indirectly in Canada\u0027s economy, as well as the impact that it has on the environment and society as a whole, Canada needs a responsible, well-informed dialogue on the range of issues flowing from the energy sector. The challenges are widespread: new global competitors including the United States itself, a supply glut in oil and natural gas, the influence of the environmental movement (in Canada and globally), public opposition to new development and transportation projects, Aboriginal rights, labour shortages in the sector, and the effectiveness of regulatory approaches are just some of the many challenges facing the industry. The energy sector—which includes oil, natural gas, hydroelectricity, nuclear energy and renewables—is under a number of pressures. The rise of the global environmental movement since the 1970s has helped to increase concerns about the overall environmental footprint of energy production, transmission and consumption, including oil and gas, nuclear and even hydro-electric power. Greenhouse gas emissions are becoming an increasing concern on the international stage, putting more pressure on Canada to show that it can lower carbon emissions Aboriginal communities have increased influence on future development of energy projects. Market access has long been a major issue for electricity generators, with provincial boundaries often acting as barriers to cleaner and more affordable power. More recently, opposition has risen against additional crude oil pipeline capacity to open new markets for rising oil sands production. A critical factor is balancing the risks and rewards of these projects across affected regions. A lack of pipeline capacity has contributed to Western Canadian oil producers receiving less than North American and world prices for their oil, a phenomenon made all the more painful by the recent, across the board decline in crude oil prices. At the same time, energy projects in Western Canada have suffered significant upward price pressures, partly due to a shortage of skilled labour. Concerns about the environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing have lead to moratoriums against shale resource development in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Quebec. Surveys indicate that trust in the ability of governments to manage these complicated issues is waning. This conference is an opportunity for you to have a voice at the table to help advance a Canadian energy and environment strategy. This event is by invitation only and registration fees have been paid for by the generous support of our Partners.

Risk managers are the eyes and ears of government, looking ahead at what could go wrong and the potential consequences, and offering advice on prudent courses of action. As such they help ensure trust in government agencies, and play a critical role in service delivery. Risk management’s role often isn’t appreciated unless something goes wrong. Little thought was given to trains running through communities until disaster struck, and few were concerned with parliamentary security until a lone gunman rampaged on Parliament Hill. Austerity, innovation, and risk. Restraint often requires innovation and transformation to increase efficiency, and this has risk implications. Doing more with less has become the norm for governments, making risk decisions even more difficult and important. Not only that, the media and public are now anticipating scandals, misappropriations, and poor project and financial management decisions. It’s not easy to successfully manage risk with higher stakes, diminished resources, and even closer scrutiny. Explore the positive potential of risk management. We will learn from past risk management issues, and we’ll also discuss how to realize the positive potential of risk management, and how risk managers can contribute to public sector innovation. Learn from the public sector risk innovators. The experts will offer practical advice from their risk management experiences, explaining how they identify, classify, communicate, and mitigate risk. This foundation will help you benchmark your risk strategy, and ensure it delivers results. As always, we’ll also examine the latest public sector risk threats, including: national security—emerging international threats, and how they should be managed and communicated to citizens cyber-security—citizens’ privacy, and how governments and corporations use and store their information the economy—being more prepared for unexpected economic risks, such as the drop in oil prices in the latter half of 2014 climate change—will climate change risk increase in importance in the next year? Participate in Canada’s top public sector risk conference. Over one thousand public sector risk leaders have participated in the Intergovernmental Forum on Risk Management since its inception. Consistent quality is what sets this event apart, and many delegates return each year to stay current and network with their peers from across the public sector. Learn from a wide range of knowledgeable speakers from inside and outside government, and benefit from their insights and practical guidance on risk planning, management, measurement, delivery, and the latest public sector risk innovations.

As employers turn their focus to building better workplaces, we all face an uncertain future. Many see a new world of opportunity opening up as a new generation rises to leadership in organizations. At the same time, small, innovative companies are driving the HR and corporate agenda with their employee-focused policies. Employees are looking for greater freedom and many employers are delivering through initiatives such as Results Only Work Environments or the Holocracy of organizations such as Zappos and Netflix. Yet, despite this, many see themselves and their colleagues overworked as they face the multiple demands of an always-on workplace. For 18 years this event has driven a discussion about wellness, change, and corporate culture—aimed at creating a more engaged and healthier workforce. Other events address aspects of this issue, but only at The Better Workplace Conference will you hear from the top change and wellness practitioners.

Social media has quickly moved from being a fringe distraction to an essential part of every organization’s communications strategy. Those who dismissed them as fleeting have been emphatically proved wrong. Communications professionals have experienced a revolutionary change in the channels available to them, and social media have transformed the relationship between customers and vendors, citizens and governments, and employers and employees. Social media has also created new communities and avenues of expression for professional and personal interests. Social media’s greatest impact on governments has been in: citizen and employee communication public consultation management generating and evaluating ideas facilitating collaboration and innovation increasing transparency developing policy removing silos that inhibit change delivering vital information during crises or emergencies Communication, consultation, and collaboration will never be the same. Find out how you can make the most of these changes. This event has been reporting from the frontlines of public sector social media for five years. Social media pioneers have shared their insights, experiences, and stories of success and failure, and have inspired and helped participants blaze their own social media trails. From liberation to radicalization—lessons in the power of social media. In 2010, social media itself grabbed headlines, as Twitter - a medium many had dismissed as trivial - emerged as a major channel for the organization of the Arab Spring. Social media had come of age. The most passionate advocates argued that this was, in fact, a “Twitter revolution,” hailing social media itself as a liberating force that would unleash democracy across the globe. The network is mightier than the sword, as it were. Much has changed since then. Twitter has gone mainstream, but now the spotlight is not on social media as tools of liberation, but rather on how ISIS use them to radicalize youth in developed countries such as Canada, the U.S., and the UK. This event will feature global expert Henry Tuck, who will share the experience of Extreme Dialogue, a project using the same tools as the terrorists to reduce the attraction of extremism to today’s youth. What’s new, and what’s next? Social media open up a whole new world of possibilities and, while many channels are well established, new tools are always emerging that promise even greater effectiveness. These new options also present new challenges, and often disrupt existing channels. Meerkat and Periscope have been generating considerable interest recently, and we’ll look into their potential, along with any other new developments that occur between now and October. Such is the nature of social media, that a few months can yield surprising and important changes. What are your greatest social media challenges? What would you like to discuss at this event? Please contact Executive Program Developer John Brewer at brewer@conferenceboard.ca with your questions, challenges, and ideas. Do you have colleagues who are eager to learn about public sector social media, a large Twitter following, plenty of Facebook friends, or loads of LinkedIn connections?
