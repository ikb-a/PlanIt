Racing sleds weigh 21�25 kilograms (46�55 lb) for singles and 25�30 kilograms (55�66 lb) for doubles. Luge is also the name of an Olympic sport. Lugers can reach speeds of 140 km per hour (87 mph). Manuel Pfister of Austria, reached a top speed of 154 km per hour (95.69 mph) on the track in Whistler, Canada prior to the 2010 Winter Olympics. Lugers compete against a timer and on artificial tracks are timed to a thousandth of a second, making luge one of the most precisely timed sports in the world. The first recorded use of the term luge is 1905, from the Savoy/Swiss dialect of French luge meaning small coasting sled, and is possibly from a Gaulish word with the same root as English sled. you can distinguish 2 different types of luge: artificial luge (called also olympic luge) and natural luge (world championships) with different sportvehicles and tracks.",
