Royal Canberra Show
The Royal Canberra Show is an agricultural show that has been staged annually in Canberra since 1927 by the Royal National Capital Agricultural Society. The show has agriculture at its core, but it has expanded with the addition of rides, competitions and educational facilities. It is said that this is where "city meets country" and "country meets city". The number of people who enter their livestock and other agricultural goods into the various competitions has increased, reflecting the significant role the Show plays in the development of the skills and excellence of those who live in the surrounding region, according to the Royal Canberra Show website. In 2012, the show marked the International Year of the Farmer.

Brazilian Carnival
Carnival of Brazil (Portuguese: Carnaval do Brasil, IPA: [ka?na'vaw]) is an annual Brazilian festival held between the Friday afternoon (51 days before Easter) and Ash Wednesday at noon, which marks the beginning of Lent, the forty-day period before Easter. On certain days of Lent, Roman Catholics and some other Christians traditionally abstained from the consumption of meat and poultry, hence the term "carnival," from carnelevare, "to remove (literally, "raise") meat." Rhythm, participation, and costumes vary from one region of Brazil to another. In the southeastern cities of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Vitória, huge organized parades are led by samba schools. Those official parades are meant to be watched by the public, while minor parades ("blocos") allowing public participation can be found in other cities.
