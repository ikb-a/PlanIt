A lot of noise is required to awaken Sun Loong who will slowly rouse himself from his year-long slumber to walk in the Gala Parade.

Also during this ceremony the Bendigo Chinese Association Lion Team perform the donation dance. This is another unique ceremony to Bendigo's Chinese community. The donation dance began as a way for the Bendigo Chinese community to raise money for the local hospitals and benevolent societies.

Toad Day Out is a pest control event which takes place in Queensland, Australia on the 29 March of each year. Its focus is to reduce the population of the invasive cane toad. The toads are caught live and unharmed. The day was originally advocated by politician Shane Knuth. Toads are captured and taken to be humanely destroyed with prizes awarded for children who find the heaviest toads, and schools which capture the most amount of toads (by weight). Before they are destroyed the toads are inspected, weighed and bagged. Most end up being turned into fertilizer, some are used for research and a few have been stuffed by a taxidermist.
