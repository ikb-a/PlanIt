	"description" : "The Double Ninth Festival (Chung Yeung Festival in Hong Kong ), observed on the ninth day of the ninth month in the Chinese calendar, is a traditional Chinese holiday, mentioned in writing since before the East Han period (before AD 25).According to the I Ching, nine is a yang number; the ninth day of the ninth lunar month (or double nine) has too much yang (a traditional Chinese spiritual concept) and is thus a potentially dangerous date. Hence, the day is also called Double Yang Festival. To protect against danger, it is customary to climb a high mountain, drink chrysanthemum liquor, and wear the zhuyu plant, Cornus officinalis. On this holiday some Chinese also visit the graves of their ancestors to pay their respects. In Hong Kong, whole extended families head to ancestral graves to clean them and repaint inscriptions, and to lay out food offerings such as roast suckling pig and fruit, which are then eaten",
