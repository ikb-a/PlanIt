	"description" : "The Super Bowl isn�t just another football game. It is the football game that brings an entire nation together for a few hours of friendly entertainment, trash talk, and some pretty creative commercials. This year celebrates the 50th time the Super Bowl will be played, making it a game to remember. If you have never attended the game in person, this would be the year of years to attend, especially in the new Levi�s Stadium, which was built to incorporate your phones and social media during the game. Don�t just watch the Super Bowl this year, be a part of it. ",
