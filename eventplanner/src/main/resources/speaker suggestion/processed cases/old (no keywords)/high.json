The training program consists of a series of six, ½ day training workshops this spring at the Centre for Social Innovation – Spadina in Toronto that will build ENGO capacity by increasing knowledge and understanding of economic concepts and their role in supporting a green economy. This combination of classroom training, information sharing and convening is designed to provide a pulse of capacity building to environmental leaders and affiliated partners and allies. The training stream takes a case-based approach to address key economic concepts, their assumptions, key measures and gaps, and their strengths and limitations.   Session #1 April 7 Assessing the Promise and Perils of Markets - Anticipate when economic markets are more likely to work or fail the environment and how markets compare to other ways of managing human interactions.    Session #2 April 21 Valuing the Priced and Unpriced Environment – How to value environmental gains and losses, using prices and non-price measures of value, so that people can be better informed about environmental and social scarcities.    Session #3 May 5 Rewarding Pro-Environmental Behaviour – How economists understand humans, and how pro-environmental behaviour can be purposefully or perversely affected, as humans act in an environmental context.    Session #4 May 19 Reconciling Trade-Offs for Better Decisions – Economic tools and strategies that can inform public decisions that involve contested gains and losses, over space and time, within and outside of the marketplace.

The training program consists of a series of six, ½ day training workshops this spring at the Centre for Social Innovation – Spadina in Toronto that will build ENGO capacity by increasing knowledge and understanding of economic concepts and their role in supporting a green economy. This combination of classroom training, information sharing and convening is designed to provide a pulse of capacity building to environmental leaders and affiliated partners and allies. The training stream takes a case-based approach to address key economic concepts, their assumptions, key measures and gaps, and their strengths and limitations.   Session #1 April 7 Assessing the Promise and Perils of Markets - Anticipate when economic markets are more likely to work or fail the environment and how markets compare to other ways of managing human interactions.    Session #2 April 21 Valuing the Priced and Unpriced Environment – How to value environmental gains and losses, using prices and non-price measures of value, so that people can be better informed about environmental and social scarcities.    Session #3 May 5 Rewarding Pro-Environmental Behaviour – How economists understand humans, and how pro-environmental behaviour can be purposefully or perversely affected, as humans act in an environmental context.    Session #4 May 19 Reconciling Trade-Offs for Better Decisions – Economic tools and strategies that can inform public decisions that involve contested gains and losses, over space and time, within and outside of the marketplace.    Session #5 June 2 Redefining Economic Progress and Sustainability – What is included, and omitted, by old and new measures of the economy, and how different forms of natural and human-created wealth relate to each other and the measurement of sustainability.

It is becoming increasingly difficult for Canada to move major energy projects forward and to help Canada shift to a cleaner energy future. Given the important role energy plays directly and indirectly in Canada\u0027s economy, as well as the impact that it has on the environment and society as a whole, Canada needs a responsible, well-informed dialogue on the range of issues flowing from the energy sector. The Conference Board of Canada believes that a holistic approach, involving multiple stakeholders across the full spectrum of the energy industry, can advance a Canadian energy and environment strategy. It is for this reason that we are holding this important event which we hope will serve as a platform to launch a new initiative in this area: The Centre on Energy, Environment and Economy to help move a strategy forward in earnest. Given the important role energy plays directly and indirectly in Canada\u0027s economy, as well as the impact that it has on the environment and society as a whole, Canada needs a responsible, well-informed dialogue on the range of issues flowing from the energy sector. The challenges are widespread: new global competitors including the United States itself, a supply glut in oil and natural gas, the influence of the environmental movement (in Canada and globally), public opposition to new development and transportation projects, Aboriginal rights, labour shortages in the sector, and the effectiveness of regulatory approaches are just some of the many challenges facing the industry. The energy sector—which includes oil, natural gas, hydroelectricity, nuclear energy and renewables—is under a number of pressures. The rise of the global environmental movement since the 1970s has helped to increase concerns about the overall environmental footprint of energy production, transmission and consumption, including oil and gas, nuclear and even hydro-electric power. Greenhouse gas emissions are becoming an increasing concern on the international stage, putting more pressure on Canada to show that it can lower carbon emissions Aboriginal communities have increased influence on future development of energy projects. Market access has long been a major issue for electricity generators, with provincial boundaries often acting as barriers to cleaner and more affordable power. More recently, opposition has risen against additional crude oil pipeline capacity to open new markets for rising oil sands production. A critical factor is balancing the risks and rewards of these projects across affected regions. A lack of pipeline capacity has contributed to Western Canadian oil producers receiving less than North American and world prices for their oil, a phenomenon made all the more painful by the recent, across the board decline in crude oil prices. At the same time, energy projects in Western Canada have suffered significant upward price pressures, partly due to a shortage of skilled labour. Concerns about the environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing have lead to moratoriums against shale resource development in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Quebec. Surveys indicate that trust in the ability of governments to manage these complicated issues is waning.

It is becoming increasingly difficult for Canada to move major energy projects forward and to help Canada shift to a cleaner energy future. Given the important role energy plays directly and indirectly in Canada\u0027s economy, as well as the impact that it has on the environment and society as a whole, Canada needs a responsible, well-informed dialogue on the range of issues flowing from the energy sector. The Conference Board of Canada believes that a holistic approach, involving multiple stakeholders across the full spectrum of the energy industry, can advance a Canadian energy and environment strategy. It is for this reason that we are holding this important event which we hope will serve as a platform to launch a new initiative in this area: The Centre on Energy, Environment and Economy to help move a strategy forward in earnest. Given the important role energy plays directly and indirectly in Canada\u0027s economy, as well as the impact that it has on the environment and society as a whole, Canada needs a responsible, well-informed dialogue on the range of issues flowing from the energy sector. The challenges are widespread: new global competitors including the United States itself, a supply glut in oil and natural gas, the influence of the environmental movement (in Canada and globally), public opposition to new development and transportation projects, Aboriginal rights, labour shortages in the sector, and the effectiveness of regulatory approaches are just some of the many challenges facing the industry. The energy sector—which includes oil, natural gas, hydroelectricity, nuclear energy and renewables—is under a number of pressures. The rise of the global environmental movement since the 1970s has helped to increase concerns about the overall environmental footprint of energy production, transmission and consumption, including oil and gas, nuclear and even hydro-electric power. Greenhouse gas emissions are becoming an increasing concern on the international stage, putting more pressure on Canada to show that it can lower carbon emissions Aboriginal communities have increased influence on future development of energy projects. Market access has long been a major issue for electricity generators, with provincial boundaries often acting as barriers to cleaner and more affordable power. More recently, opposition has risen against additional crude oil pipeline capacity to open new markets for rising oil sands production. A critical factor is balancing the risks and rewards of these projects across affected regions. A lack of pipeline capacity has contributed to Western Canadian oil producers receiving less than North American and world prices for their oil, a phenomenon made all the more painful by the recent, across the board decline in crude oil prices. At the same time, energy projects in Western Canada have suffered significant upward price pressures, partly due to a shortage of skilled labour. Concerns about the environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing have lead to moratoriums against shale resource development in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Quebec.

Given the important role energy plays directly and indirectly in Canada\u0027s economy, as well as the impact that it has on the environment and society as a whole, Canada needs a responsible, well-informed dialogue on the range of issues flowing from the energy sector. The Conference Board of Canada believes that a holistic approach, involving multiple stakeholders across the full spectrum of the energy industry, can advance a Canadian energy and environment strategy. It is for this reason that we are holding this important event which we hope will serve as a platform to launch a new initiative in this area: The Centre on Energy, Environment and Economy to help move a strategy forward in earnest. Given the important role energy plays directly and indirectly in Canada\u0027s economy, as well as the impact that it has on the environment and society as a whole, Canada needs a responsible, well-informed dialogue on the range of issues flowing from the energy sector. The challenges are widespread: new global competitors including the United States itself, a supply glut in oil and natural gas, the influence of the environmental movement (in Canada and globally), public opposition to new development and transportation projects, Aboriginal rights, labour shortages in the sector, and the effectiveness of regulatory approaches are just some of the many challenges facing the industry. The energy sector—which includes oil, natural gas, hydroelectricity, nuclear energy and renewables—is under a number of pressures. The rise of the global environmental movement since the 1970s has helped to increase concerns about the overall environmental footprint of energy production, transmission and consumption, including oil and gas, nuclear and even hydro-electric power. Greenhouse gas emissions are becoming an increasing concern on the international stage, putting more pressure on Canada to show that it can lower carbon emissions Aboriginal communities have increased influence on future development of energy projects. Market access has long been a major issue for electricity generators, with provincial boundaries often acting as barriers to cleaner and more affordable power. More recently, opposition has risen against additional crude oil pipeline capacity to open new markets for rising oil sands production. A critical factor is balancing the risks and rewards of these projects across affected regions. A lack of pipeline capacity has contributed to Western Canadian oil producers receiving less than North American and world prices for their oil, a phenomenon made all the more painful by the recent, across the board decline in crude oil prices. At the same time, energy projects in Western Canada have suffered significant upward price pressures, partly due to a shortage of skilled labour. Concerns about the environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing have lead to moratoriums against shale resource development in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Quebec. Surveys indicate that trust in the ability of governments to manage these complicated issues is waning. This conference is an opportunity for you to have a voice at the table to help advance a Canadian energy and environment strategy.

Risk managers are the eyes and ears of government, looking ahead at what could go wrong and the potential consequences, and offering advice on prudent courses of action. As such they help ensure trust in government agencies, and play a critical role in service delivery. Risk management’s role often isn’t appreciated unless something goes wrong.

We will learn from past risk management issues, and we’ll also discuss how to realize the positive potential of risk management, and how risk managers can contribute to public sector innovation.

As employers turn their focus to building better workplaces, we all face an uncertain future. Many see a new world of opportunity opening up as a new generation rises to leadership in organizations. At the same time, small, innovative companies are driving the HR and corporate agenda with their employee-focused policies. Employees are looking for greater freedom and many employers are delivering through initiatives such as Results Only Work Environments or the Holocracy of organizations such as Zappos and Netflix. Yet, despite this, many see themselves and their colleagues overworked as they face the multiple demands of an always-on workplace. For 18 years this event has driven a discussion about wellness, change, and corporate culture—aimed at creating a more engaged and healthier workforce.

On the contrary. Knowledge is never used up. It increases by diffusion and grows by dispersion.” Babbage and Boorstin got it right. Data does matter and, when used effectively, can help your organization be more productive and cost effective, and more attractive to employees and investors alike. With benefits costs rising, an aging population, new breakthroughs in specialty medications and the constant need to manage costs, accurate information on which to base your benefits and disability management decisions is essential. This event is your source for that information. Learn from new benefits benchmarking research! The Conference Board’s newest benefits benchmarking report will be presented publicly for the first time at this event. This survey of hundreds of Canadian employers will give you a wealth of real-world data and experience to draw upon. Its insights will include: benefit plans priorities costs and funding issues trends and innovations in plan design coverage changes for current employees and retirees transition of the benefits function within organizations New research on the ROI of specialty medications! Be the first to benefit from the latest Canadian data on the return on investment (ROI) of specialty medications. This ground-breaking Conference Board study will give you critical insights into the efficacy and cost effectiveness of medications used to treat three prevalent diseases. Learn how others are maximizing health and well-being, while holding the line on costs. This year’s conference is rich with evidence-based insights and practical advice, to help you build successful and cost effective initiatives. Employers, thought leaders, and researchers will examine how you can improve your organization’s benefits and absence and disability management practices. Are your benefits working as hard as they can for your organization? Top employers will highlight key aspects of their benefit plans, and share their insights on what works and what doesn’t in plan design. We’ll also discuss the latest statistics, the strategic use of data, and how to measure the return on investment of your benefits plan. Does your wellness strategy address today’s greatest challenges? The experts will share their thinking on substance use and abuse issues for employers, and options for the return to work by employees dealing with addictions. You’ll also hear about the drivers of drug costs, and opportunities to better manage those costs, and how to engage middle managers in workplace mental health initiatives.

Social media has quickly moved from being a fringe distraction to an essential part of every organization’s communications strategy. Those who dismissed them as fleeting have been emphatically proved wrong. Communications professionals have experienced a revolutionary change in the channels available to them, and social media have transformed the relationship between customers and vendors, citizens and governments, and employers and employees. Social media has also created new communities and avenues of expression for professional and personal interests. Social media’s greatest impact on governments has been in: citizen and employee communication public consultation management generating and evaluating ideas facilitating collaboration and innovation increasing transparency developing policy removing silos that inhibit change delivering vital information during crises or emergencies Communication, consultation, and collaboration will never be the same. Find out how you can make the most of these changes. This event has been reporting from the frontlines of public sector social media for five years. Social media pioneers have shared their insights, experiences, and stories of success and failure, and have inspired and helped participants blaze their own social media trails. From liberation to radicalization—lessons in the power of social media. In 2010, social media itself grabbed headlines, as Twitter - a medium many had dismissed as trivial - emerged as a major channel for the organization of the Arab Spring. Social media had come of age. The most passionate advocates argued that this was, in fact, a “Twitter revolution,” hailing social media itself as a liberating force that would unleash democracy across the globe. The network is mightier than the sword, as it were. Much has changed since then. Twitter has gone mainstream, but now the spotlight is not on social media as tools of liberation, but rather on how ISIS use them to radicalize youth in developed countries such as Canada, the U.S., and the UK. This event will feature global expert Henry Tuck, who will share the experience of Extreme Dialogue, a project using the same tools as the terrorists to reduce the attraction of extremism to today’s youth. What’s new, and what’s next? Social media open up a whole new world of possibilities and, while many channels are well established, new tools are always emerging that promise even greater effectiveness. These new options also present new challenges, and often disrupt existing channels. Meerkat and Periscope have been generating considerable interest recently, and we’ll look into their potential, along with any other new developments that occur between now and October. Such is the nature of social media, that a few months can yield surprising and important changes. What are your greatest social media challenges? What would you like to discuss at this event? Please contact Executive Program Developer John Brewer at brewer@conferenceboard.ca with your questions, challenges, and ideas. Do you have colleagues who are eager to learn about public sector social media, a large Twitter following, plenty of Facebook friends, or loads of LinkedIn connections?

Social media has quickly moved from being a fringe distraction to an essential part of every organization’s communications strategy. Those who dismissed them as fleeting have been emphatically proved wrong. Communications professionals have experienced a revolutionary change in the channels available to them, and social media have transformed the relationship between customers and vendors, citizens and governments, and employers and employees. Social media has also created new communities and avenues of expression for professional and personal interests. Social media’s greatest impact on governments has been in: citizen and employee communication public consultation management generating and evaluating ideas facilitating collaboration and innovation increasing transparency developing policy removing silos that inhibit change delivering vital information during crises or emergencies Communication, consultation, and collaboration will never be the same. Find out how you can make the most of these changes. This event has been reporting from the frontlines of public sector social media for five years. Social media pioneers have shared their insights, experiences, and stories of success and failure, and have inspired and helped participants blaze their own social media trails. From liberation to radicalization—lessons in the power of social media. In 2010, social media itself grabbed headlines, as Twitter - a medium many had dismissed as trivial - emerged as a major channel for the organization of the Arab Spring. Social media had come of age. The most passionate advocates argued that this was, in fact, a “Twitter revolution,” hailing social media itself as a liberating force that would unleash democracy across the globe. The network is mightier than the sword, as it were. Much has changed since then. Twitter has gone mainstream, but now the spotlight is not on social media as tools of liberation, but rather on how ISIS use them to radicalize youth in developed countries such as Canada, the U.S., and the UK. This event will feature global expert Henry Tuck, who will share the experience of Extreme Dialogue, a project using the same tools as the terrorists to reduce the attraction of extremism to today’s youth. What’s new, and what’s next? Social media open up a whole new world of possibilities and, while many channels are well established, new tools are always emerging that promise even greater effectiveness. These new options also present new challenges, and often disrupt existing channels. Meerkat and Periscope have been generating considerable interest recently, and we’ll look into their potential, along with any other new developments that occur between now and October. Such is the nature of social media, that a few months can yield surprising and important changes. What are your greatest social media challenges? What would you like to discuss at this event?
