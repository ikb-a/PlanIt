      "description": "Citizens expect governments to protect them, help in emergencies, and be prudent managers of resources. Risk managers are the eyes and ears of government, looking ahead at what could go wrong and the potential consequences, and offering advice on prudent courses of action. As such they help ensure trust in government agencies, and play a critical role in service delivery. Risk management’s role often isn’t appreciated unless something goes wrong. Little thought was given to trains running through communities until disaster struck, and few were concerned with parliamentary security until a lone gunman rampaged on Parliament Hill. Austerity, innovation, and risk. Restraint often requires innovation and transformation to increase efficiency, and this has risk implications. Doing more with less has become the norm for governments, making risk decisions even more difficult and important. Not only that, the media and public are now anticipating scandals, misappropriations, and poor project and financial management decisions. It’s not easy to successfully manage risk with higher stakes, diminished resources, and even closer scrutiny. Explore the positive potential of risk management. We will learn from past risk management issues, and we’ll also discuss how to realize the positive potential of risk management, and how risk managers can contribute to public sector innovation. Learn from the public sector risk innovators. The experts will offer practical advice from their risk management experiences, explaining how they identify, classify, communicate, and mitigate risk.
