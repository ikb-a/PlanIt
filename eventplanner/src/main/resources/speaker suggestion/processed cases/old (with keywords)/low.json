Session #3 May 5 Rewarding Pro-Environmental Behaviour – How economists understand humans, and how pro-environmental behaviour can be purposefully or perversely affected, as humans act in an environmental context.    Session #4 May 19 Reconciling Trade-Offs for Better Decisions – Economic tools and strategies that can inform public decisions that involve contested gains and losses, over space and time, within and outside of the marketplace.    Session #5 June 2 Redefining Economic Progress and Sustainability – What is included, and omitted, by old and new measures of the economy, and how different forms of natural and human-created wealth relate to each other and the measurement of sustainability.
