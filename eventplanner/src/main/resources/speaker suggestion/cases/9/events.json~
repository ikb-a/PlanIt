      "title":"Benefits and Disability Management 2015: From Research to Action",
      "description":"“Errors using inadequate data are much less than those using no data at all.” “Knowledge is not simply another commodity. On the contrary. Knowledge is never used up. It increases by diffusion and grows by dispersion.” Babbage and Boorstin got it right. Data does matter and, when used effectively, can help your organization be more productive and cost effective, and more attractive to employees and investors alike. With benefits costs rising, an aging population, new breakthroughs in specialty medications and the constant need to manage costs, accurate information on which to base your benefits and disability management decisions is essential. This event is your source for that information. Learn from new benefits benchmarking research! The Conference Board’s newest benefits benchmarking report will be presented publicly for the first time at this event. This survey of hundreds of Canadian employers will give you a wealth of real-world data and experience to draw upon. Its insights will include: benefit plans priorities costs and funding issues trends and innovations in plan design coverage changes for current employees and retirees transition of the benefits function within organizations New research on the ROI of specialty medications!

We’ll also discuss the latest statistics, the strategic use of data, and how to measure the return on investment of your benefits plan.
