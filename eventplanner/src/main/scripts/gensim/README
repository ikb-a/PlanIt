The pre-requisite for using the server is that the environment variable GENSIM_SERVER is set to this directory

To initiate the server:
> $GENSIM_SERVER/server.py &

To initiate the client:
> $GENSIM_SERVER/client.py

The file "words" contains a sample input for client.py.
E.g.
> cat words | $GENSIM_SERVER/client.py
