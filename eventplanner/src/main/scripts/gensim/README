The pre-requisite for using the server is that the environment variable GENSIM_SERVER is set to this directory

To initiate the server:
> $GENSIM_SERVER/server.py &

To initiate the client:
> $GENSIM_SERVER/client.py

The file "words" contains a sample input for client.py.
E.g.
> cat words | $GENSIM_SERVER/client.py

server.py requires the gensim package (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gensim), tendo
The default model is to use GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin, available from https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/.
Script must be modified so that the variable word2vec_model_path points to the GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin
