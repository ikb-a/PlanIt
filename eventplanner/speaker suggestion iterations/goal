What I want to say:

Here are ~4 sources which are functions f:(event, speaker) -> {good, bad, best}

When I train a classifier with them I get these levels of precision and recall.
When I do attribute selection on them I find that these are the best

Here are ~10 cases of data which are classified incorrectly.
5 are "best" but should be "bad"
5 are "bad" but shoule be "best"
How did each source classify them?

Make a table where each source and each case can be drawn out to see where sources
went wrong.
