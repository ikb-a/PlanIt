Keyword sources were comparing these two words lists:
Event : [community, intelligent, cities, livability, icf, mayors, Toronto]
Speaker : [Business & Workplace, Innovation & Change Management, Performance & Productivity]

Debugging this case revealed something important: when speech topics were compared to event keywords we did not parse the speech topics into their component words. After a small change we are now comparing:

Event : [community, intelligent, cities, livability, icf, mayors, Toronto]
Speaker : [business, workplace, innovation, change, management, performance, productivity]
